# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

Product preview card component is a sample project l took from Frontend mentor. lt does not really do much, just used HTML as the skeleton and CSS to add the beautiful flesh to it. Also, I used flexbox for my layout.

# MY MOTIVATION (PRACTICE MAKES ONE PERFECT).

Though this project may look simple, it really is a technical one. At the end, l am pround that l managed to do it myself and hoping to hop onto other interesting projects.
